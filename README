POP3 Client and Server
Author: Vincent Barfield
Class: CS4461

How to compile: Once the folder has been extracted, verify it contains a file named 'makefile'. Assuming it's there (which it should be), just type 'make'. This will produce two executables as well as some object (*.o) files.

How to Test: Open two terminals on your machine. In each terminal, navigate to the directory containing the designated executables. In the first terminal, type './server <port>' where '<port> is some port. In the second terminal, type './client localhost <port>' where '<port>' is the same port number you used for the server.
You should now be able to type the POP3 commands specified in the project specifications into the client terminal.
A few examples:
	- 'STAT'
	- 'LIST'
	- 'RETR 1'
	- 'TOP 1 1'
	- 'DELE 1'
